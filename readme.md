## Work In Progress

- This site was created in approx ~4 hours. I haven't used PHP since I was 16. This was done with only PHP Docs,StackOverflow and W3School.

* Really wanted to test my discipline and knowledge of teaching myself new things. I believe I did pretty well. And yes I will take a formal PHP OOP course to learn and do the rest.
